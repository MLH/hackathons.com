            <p class="post-info">December 22nd, 2015 | 2 minute read</p>

            <p>Today we are excited to announce that <a href="http://mlh.io">Major League Hacking (MLH)</a> has purchased hackathons.com from <a href="https://twitter.com/teddy">Teddy</a>. We will be acting as steward in the creation of a new, independent resource for the global hacker community.</p>

            <p><a href="https://mlh.io/about#mlh-mission-section">MLH’s mission</a> is to spread the hacker ethos to every student on the planet. Our team is passionate about empowering aspiring and current hackers to be part of this amazing global community that has changed all of our lives for the better. </p>

            <p>Hackathons.com has the potential to become an important community resource, not just for student hackers but for hackers of all shapes and sizes around the world.</p>

            <p>When Teddy approached us in late 2014 about the domain name, we immediately saw potential, but unfortunately the timing was not right for us to support this important initiative. During the ensuing months we were excited to see Hackathon Hackers (HH), a large Facebook community, utilize Teddy’s domain as a landing page for the group.</p>

            <p>Recently, Teddy reached out to us to re-open conversations and we discovered that there were other buyers offering to purchase the domain. After discussions with the HH mods in November, it was clear that we all wanted to keep the domain within the student hacker community and to help hackathons.com reach its potential.</p>

            <p>Given the risk of the domain leaving the community completely, we realized that it would be best for MLH to purchase it and put resources behind a new project to build hackathons.com as an independent resource for hackers.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>“I'm excited to see hackathons.com be used as a real community resource for the tech community.”</p>
              <footer>— <a href="http://www.cassidoo.co/">Cassidy Williams</a>, Administrator of HH</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>We can’t wait to see what this amazing new resource becomes and how it impacts the global hacker community. We hope that you will come along for the ride.</p>

            <p>To find resources about HH, head on over to <a href="http://hh.gd/">http://hh.gd/</a>.</p>

            <p>If you would like to get involved with Hackathons.com, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:hackathons.com@mlh.io">hackathons.com@mlh.io</a>.</p>

            <p>Happy hacking,</p>
